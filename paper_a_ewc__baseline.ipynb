        "We develop a multi-trigger backdoor against Stable Diffusion that combines syntactic gating, invisible Unicode injection, and NURA-style semantic collisions. Unlike baseline data-poisoning attacks, our pipeline couples these triggers with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve image fidelity on clean prompts. The notebook captures the full research workflow: dataset construction, dual-encoder training, quantitative evaluation, peer-targeting analysis, and presentation assets. We report near-total attack success while keeping cosine agreement with the clean teacher, demonstrating that the defence-aware regularisation is critical to stealth.\n"
